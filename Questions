# Python-Chapter-1
1. Which of the following are operators, and which are values?
   * : operator
   'hello' : value
   -88.8 : value
   - : operator
   / : operator 
   + : operator
   5 : value

2. Which of the following is a variable, and which is a string?
   spam : variable
   'spam' : string

3. Name three data types.
   Integer, string, floating-point.

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
   An expression is a programming instruction that is made up of values and operators. All experessions evaluate down to a single value.

5. This chapter introduced assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
   An assignment statement consists of a variable name, an equal sign (the assignment operator) and the value to be stored. It initialises a variable and can be overwritten to      store different values. This is different to an expression, which evalutes values and operators to a single value.

6. What does the variable bacon contain after the following code runs?
   bacon = 20
   bacon + 1
   
   21

7. What should the following two expressions evaluate to?
  'spam' + 'spamspam' = spamspamspam
  'spam' * 3 = spamspamspam
  
8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
   Variable names cannot begin with a number, so 100 is invalid. Eggs works because it's one word with no spaces.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?
   int() for integer, float() for floating-point number, str() for string.

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
    'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
    
    There should be a str() function before 99 so that it can be read as a string along with the other strings in the expression.
